TransportDroidIL
================

TransportDroidIL is a neat little android app for getting bus & train times for
Israel. It was written by Ohad Lutzky <ohad@lutzky.net>.

How it works
------------

TransportDroidIL receives user input and sends it to either
[Egged](http://egged.co.il) or the [Ministry of Transport](http://bus.gov.il)
sites, using the free-text engine there. Since the sites are nearly identical
in implementation, it's not a lot of extra work. Any information reported by
the application comes from those two sites, so we support whatever queries they
do. Also, for convenience, there's a history-based autocompleter.

License

The source code for TransportDroidIL is available under the GPL license, as
available in the COPYING file. TransportDroidIL is also available for purchase
on the Android Market. You are free to compile the code and use it on your
phone for free. While you are legally permitted to distribute the APK for free
(or, hell, even sell it), I kindly ask that you don't do this. Consider it
donationware with a tax on non-developers :)
